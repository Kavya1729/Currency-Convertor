## **Official Vite Plugins**

Currently, two official plugins are available to enhance your development experience:

- **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: Uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: Uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.

Both plugins provide a fast, modern experience for React development, with minimal configuration.
